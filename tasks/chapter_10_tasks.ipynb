    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Learn how to create a new branch, make changes, and merge it into the main branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone the `sd_chap_10` GitHub repository:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git clone https://github.com/rhkraptor/sd_chap_10.git\n",
    "   cd sd_chap_10\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a new branch:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git checkout -b feature-yourname\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Modify the file: `README.md`  \n",
    "   ➤ Add your name and GitHub handle under a section titled `Contributors`.\n",

    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git add README.md\n",
    "   git commit -m \"Add yourname to Contributors section\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Switch to main and merge:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git checkout main\n",
    "   git merge feature-yourname\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git fetch upstream\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Merge changes from upstream `main` into your local `main`:\n",
